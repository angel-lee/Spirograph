# Spirograph

 A spirograph consists of a stator, rotor, and pen. The stator is the fixed outer circle and the rotor is the inner circle that moves inside the stator. The rotor contains holes that a pen could be placed on. Then, the rotor is placed inside the stator and the user moves and rotates the rotor around to create a shape called a hypotrochoid. This Java program emulates a spirograph toy, drawing a hypotrochoid dependent on the parameters of the stator, rotor, and pen.
To begin, run the program. Then, adjust the parameters of the stator radius, rotor radius, pen location, pen stroke size, pen and background colors, and the animation speed to your liking. When you are ready, press Start and watch the animation begin. You may press Stop to stop the animation or wait until it ends. To set all parameters back to their default settings, press Reset.
To access the menu, click on File in the top left corner. If you click on Save image, you will be prompted to input a name for your saved png file. If you click on Exit, then the program will terminate.

Rules:
1. The rotor radius must be less than the stator radius
2. The pen location radius must be less than the rotor radius
3. None of the values may be zero (except for the colors)
4. While the pen is drawing, only the RGB sliders may still be moved. If you wish to
change any other parameters, you must first press Stop, then make the changes that you wish to make.
